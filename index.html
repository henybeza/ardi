              Francis of Assisi was born in late 1181 or early 1182,one of several children of an Italian father,Pietro di Bernardone dei Moriconi, a prosperous silk merchant, and a French mother, Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except that she was a noblewoman originally from Provence.Pietro was in France on business when Francis was born in Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni.Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco("the Frenchman"),possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy,the change can hardly have had anything to do with his aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.
